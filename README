ENVFILE(1)           BSD General Commands Manual            ENVFILE(1)

NAME
     envfile - execute a command under a crafted environment

SYNOPSIS
     envfile foo.env -- program [argv...]

DESCRIPTION
     The envfile(1)  is a  program to  run another  program; much
     like  sudo(1) or  chroot(1).   The difference  is that  this
     program is  designed to modify environment  variables before
     that.

FILES
     The  `envfile(1)` program  takes an  env file  as its  first
     argument.  They can either be one of

      * Perl program when their suffixes are '.pl' or '.perl';
      * JSON file when their suffixes are '.js' or '.json';
      * YAML file when their suffixes are '.yml' or '.yaml';
      * Otherwise envfile  formatted, where KEY=VALUE is written
        each line.
  
EXAMPLES
        $ cat > foo.env
        FOO=foo
        BAR=bar
        ^D
        $ envfile foo.env ruby -e 'puts ENV["FOO"], ENV["BAR"]'
        foo
        bar
